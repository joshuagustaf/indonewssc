# indonewssc

Indonesia trending news scraper targeting three popular news sources (Detik, LINE TODAY, and ANTARA News).

The program uses scrapy as the web scraper.
The crawlers in /INTS/spiders use xpath to target the title of the news.

I made a shell script to make the scraper run automatically every hour. 
Example result could be found in /INTS/Example - LINE TODAY.mp4

Please give a credit if you want to use and modify this program.
