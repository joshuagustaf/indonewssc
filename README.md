# Indonesia Trending News Scraper

A web scraper targets three popular news sources (Detik, LINE TODAY, and ANTARA News). The program uses scrapy as the web scraper.


The crawlers in /INTS/spiders use xpath to target the title of the news. I made a shell script to make the scraper run automatically every hour. 

The data from the scraper could be used to visualize the current trends.
Example result could be found in /INTS/Example - LINE TODAY.mp4
